Now we'll use the configuration elements defined in the previous step to actually implement an integration test. Head back to the [Datadog integration documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/integrations/new_check_howto/#writing-tests) and look for the second part of `awesome/tests/test_awesome.py` (the one that starts with `@pytest.mark.integration`), then add it to our local copy of that same file.
